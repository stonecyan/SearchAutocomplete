This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


Code was written for the React portion of the coding challenge, creating an autocomplete search bar from the randomly generate names. The names are displayed underneath in a list as you type. I added some styling to restrict the area of the list and highlight the selection if you scroll through with arrow keys. You can also click on a name to select it.
